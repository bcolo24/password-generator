# password-generator

## Description

This password generator was created as a way for a user to input the length and type of password, to receive a random combination of characters created by this site. I built this project because it is important to have safe passwords and this random generator makes that easy. With the technology that exists, it is not uncommon for information to be hacked and stolen. The best way to prevent that is to use passwords that are unique. The strongest passwords consist of at least one number, special charatcer, uppercase letter, and lowercase letter. They also should be at least eight characters. This password generator ensures that the user has the option to include each of those items. While creating this project,  I learned about safe passwords and how to apply javascript to a website to give it a unique function. 

## Installation
N/A

## Usage

To use this website, select a password length between 8 and 128 characters. Then, you will be asked to confirm whether or not you would like uppercase characters, lowercase characters, special characters, or numbers in the password. To choose "yes", select the "Ok" button. To choose "no", select the "Cancel" button.
